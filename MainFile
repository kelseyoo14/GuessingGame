''' Welcome to my program! I *hope* I've thought of most of the loop holes for this guessing 
game, and closed them up. What I had a hard time figuring out, was what to do if the user 
entered a string instead of a number for their guess. Originally I was using input() instead 
of raw_input(), since it differentiated for me wether or not what was entered was a string
or an integer. When the input was a number, the program ran fine, but whenever a string was 
entered, it broke. Now it works! I also had some difficulty figuring out where in the function 
guessingGame() to place the addGuess() function (to add new guesses to the array(guessedNumbers)),
to keep track of the guesses and only include new, valid guesses between 1 and 100. Finally 
figured it out though, and now it works beautifully and counts the guesses correctly! 
Just for fun, I added the options for a user to choose to continue playing if they want, or to be 
able to leave the game at any time. 
For now, this is my finished piece. Hope you enjoy guessing! '''
